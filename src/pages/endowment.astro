                            sustainably addressing gaps in the OSS funding landscape.

                                There is no perfect model for OSS grants. Our approach is an open
                                data-driven <a href="https://github.com/osendowment/model" target="_blank">model</a>
                                that is developed and approved by OSE Members — people who actually
                                power it with funding.

                                The target model will trace links from popular ecosystems (like Python and
                                JavaScript) to underlying packages, creating a natural priority for low-level
                                libraries (like C and Fortran).

                                    Within each ecosystem, we use a model based on Value and Risk scores. They are
                                    calculated based on multiple open data points and are used to sort projects.
                                    Our target format is microgrants (~$5,000) to high-risk candidates among
                                    the most valuable OSS, approved by the board after manual due diligence.

                            All donations to the Endowment are put into diversified investments, and only the yearly
                            income from these investments is used to fund grants. This approach supports
                            long-term planning and sustainable funding for OSS.

                            At the start, OSE invested in US Treasury bonds, which are very low-risk and earn ~5% per year. Now, the portfolio is being transferred to a professional asset manager, <a href="https://www.infinitegiving.com/" target="_blank">Infinite Giving</a>, chosen by the board thanks to its US nonprofit specialization.

                            Targeting a 7-8% return with 5% annual spend on grants, most of the
                            remaining earnings will be reinvested after covering basic operating costs.
