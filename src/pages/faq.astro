                        <h3>What is the Open Source Endowment (OSE)?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>OSE is the world's first endowment fund for open source software. It invests donations into a low-risk portfolio and spends only the returns to fund maintainers of critical yet underfunded OSS across the globe. OSE is a US 501(c)(3) public charity, incorporated on February 14, 2025.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why does OSS need sustainable funding?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Open source runs the modern world: <a href="https://www.blackduck.com/blog/appsec-decoded-open-source-trends-ossra-report.html" target="_blank">over 95% of codebases</a> rely on OSS, with applications averaging <a href="https://www.blackduck.com/blog/appsec-decoded-open-source-trends-ossra-report.html" target="_blank">500+ open source components</a>. Like roads and bridges, OSS requires ongoing maintenance to fix bugs, patch security issues, and adapt to changes.</p>
                            <p>Yet <a href="https://opensourcefundingsurvey2024.com/" target="_blank">86% of contributors</a> are unpaid, and many critical projects lack resources. Without sustainable funding, this is a very fragile foundation for the global software supply chain — leading to incidents like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> (2014) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell">Log4Shell</a> (2021).</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why are current funding solutions not truly sustainable?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Open source has various funding sources: corporate budgets, nonprofit foundations, government programs, personal donations, etc. However, most depend on volatile annual budgets or ad hoc donations that strongly fluctuate with economic and political conditions.</p>
                            <p>A recession, a corporate strategy shift, or a change of government team can cut OSS budgets overnight — leaving critical projects without support and seriously increasing risks for all of us.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why is OSE unique and sustainable?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>OSE complements existing solutions by filling the funding gaps in a sustainable way. It is the only institution that simultaneously combines three features:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Sustainable funding</strong> — an endowment model that spends only investment returns, providing stable cash flow independent of annual donations or volatile budgets.</li>
                                <li><strong>Systemic focus</strong> — targets critical underfunded OSS, prioritizing the "long tail" instead of popular, large, or vendor-specific supply chains.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scalability and efficiency</strong> — a transparent, digital-first approach to attracting donors and selecting grantees, designed to grow over time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>By combining all three into a single nonprofit product, OSE provides a predictable, perpetual funding stream for maintainers of the most critical OSS, reducing risks of the global software supply chain our world depends on.</p>

                        <h3>How do I donate?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>People and organizations are welcome to <a href={EVERYORG_BUTTON_URL}>donate here</a>. We accept card payments, Apple/Google Pay, US and international bank transfers, donor-advised funds (DAF), crypto, public and private stock — all non-USD assets are automatically converted.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Every public donation to OSE goes directly to the endowment fund — they are invested, not spent. Only the investment returns are used to fund grants to open source projects.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>People who give $1,000 or more become <strong>OSE Members</strong> — with governance rights including advising the Board on strategy and grant-making, appointing community-nominated directors, and voting on key decisions. Each $1,000 grants one year of membership. See the <a href="/docs/membership-policy">membership policy</a> for details.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> OSE is a US 501(c)(3) tax-exempt public charity (EIN 33-3502715), so donations are <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions" target="_blank">tax-deductible</a> to the full extent permitted by law. Individuals can deduct up to 60% of adjusted gross income for cash donations; corporations up to 25% of taxable income. Unused deductions carry forward for up to five years.</p>

                        <h3>Why did OSE accept only individuals as founding donors?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>OSE is a grassroots nonprofit governed by individual donors — people with a passion for open source and skin in the game. Endowments require a 20+ year horizon, and most organizations plan for far shorter periods. We are intentionally building a lasting global neutral institution, not a corporate nonprofit.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>Yes!</strong> We already have {orgDonorCount} <a href="/community">institutional donors</a> in our community, and we welcome more companies and foundations that care about open source. However, we do not offer them governing rights to preserve the long-term neutrality and alignment with the global open source community.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The <strong>Board of Directors</strong> is the main governing body, responsible for OSE strategy, investments, grants, etc. It combines board-appointed and member-elected directors. All directors serve unpaid and must be Members. The Board meets at least four times a year; meeting minutes are published in our <a href="/docs">docs</a>. See the <a href="/docs/bylaws">bylaws</a> for full details.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>Executive Director</strong> manages day-to-day operations and reports to the Board. The ED is appointed by the Board for up to three years and must be a Member. OSE also engages <strong>Advisors</strong> — thematic experts who help the Board on various topics and, unlike directors and officers, are not required to be Members.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>OSE is designed to become a self-governing institution run by a diverse community of Members, having personal commitments to open source. Over time, they will elect more and more Board directors. The Board, meanwhile, is focused on building scalable, transparent systems — so that OSE operates efficiently with minimal management overhead and remains open for new contributors.</p>

                            <p>All donations are put into diversified investments managed by a professional asset manager. The board chose <a href="https://www.infinitegiving.com/">Infinite Giving</a>, specializing in US nonprofits, as our outsourced CIO, targeting a 7–8% return.</p>

                        <h3>What principles guide OSE's grantmaking?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>OSE aims to ensure sustainable maintenance of the most critical OSS projects, reducing risks to the global software supply chain by addressing funding gaps. Our key principles:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Long-term impact</strong>: Priority on fixing underlying issues (e.g., maintainer burnout) instead of fighting their surface-level consequences (e.g., vulnerabilities). There are already enough organizations doing "firefighting" in the global village of open source; OSE's role is more about funding the preventive installation of "fire safety measures" in the most critical buildings.</li>
                                <li><strong>Follow the market</strong>: OSE is not opinionated about which software is more valuable and worthy of support, and bases its neutral judgment on an internal estimation of how the world consumes OSS. Such an approach accounts for the full dependency tree and naturally prioritizes low-level infrastructure libraries (e.g., C/C++) over more app-focused ecosystems (e.g., JS/TS).</li>
                                <li><strong>Measurable and transparent</strong>: Algorithmic (but not automatic!) data-driven selection of grantees, based on a model co-developed with OSE donors, with human-in-the-loop elements. It will be open to OSE Members and partially to the public.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How will the selection model work?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>OSE is currently developing the selection model and planning to release its first version in Q1 2026. It will use a scoring approach based on the estimated value and risk for top OSS projects. Here are their potential components:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Value for the ecosystem</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Dependencies</li>
                                        <li>Downloads</li>
                                        <li>Potential losses if removed from the global tree</li>
                                        <li>Endorsements from OSE donors, OSS foundations, etc.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Risk of the project</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Complexity: LOCs, etc.</li>
                                        <li>Maintainers: active maintainers, bus factor, MTTR for issues, etc.</li>

                        <h3>Does OSE support OSS projects that have a related tech business?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>If an open source project can turn into a sustainable business, it probably should.</p>
                            <p>OSE supports only nonprofit projects, excluding VC-funded startups and projects with corporate origins. One simple test is trademark ownership. Here are examples of great open source projects that OSE <strong>will not</strong> support:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Kubernetes</strong> — originated at Google, which initially owned its trademark; now hosted at the Linux Foundation</li>
                                <li><strong>ClickHouse</strong> — actively commercialized by ClickHouse Inc, which owns its trademark</li>
                                <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> — while its trademark has an <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Trademark_issues">unclear history</a>, many Postgres-as-a-Service companies (like Supabase and Neon) actively contribute to its development</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>OSE awards funding in two forms:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Forward-looking grants</strong> — funding a specific, measurable chunk of work that will de-risk the project (e.g., fixing a class of vulnerabilities, onboarding a co-maintainer).</li>
                                <li><strong>Backward-looking awards</strong> — recognizing maintainers who have sustained critical projects for years or decades without adequate support, helping reduce burnout.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Impact is measured both quantitatively (data-driven metrics) and qualitatively (check-in calls). We also aim to highlight critical maintainers so the broader community can join OSE in supporting them.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>In the short term, there is no such problem at all. As for the long term, the tech industry has been capable of building robust systems with automated inputs that can't be easily gamed — like Google Search, YouTube, and all large social networks, including GitHub. The selection model can't be perfect, but we aim to make it openly developed, and "with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."</p>

                        <h3>Why did nobody build an OSS endowment before OSE?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>Endowments require a 20+ year horizon</strong> — most organizations, including charities, optimize for quick wins and annual budgets; spending only ~5% of donations per year is a hard sell. Governments struggle to explain OSS to voters. Companies shift priorities too often. Endowments are created by passionate individuals.</p>
                            <p><strong>The target must have an unlimited lifespan</strong> — most OSS communities center around specific software (Linux), languages (Python), or people. These targets have limited lifespan, making project-specific endowments eventually irrelevant. OSS-at-large, however, is an open-ended target.</p>
                            <p><strong>It requires a rare intersection of expertise</strong> — open source, endowment governance, startup scaling, fundraising, and nonprofit law. Most OSS people are unfamiliar with the endowment model, especially outside the US/UK. Most philanthropists are unfamiliar with open source — this problem didn't exist 25 years ago.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Transparency is a foundational value of OSE as a community-driven nonprofit project. Currently, most OSE-related discussions and key documents are available for OSE Members and advisors at our <a href="https://github.com/osendowment/foundation">private repo</a>, which will become fully open at the public launch (after 501(c)(3) status approval). We already have a few public GitHub repos available for contributing and plan to publish more in the future.</p>

                        <h3>How can OSE evolve in the long term, especially in an AI-powered world?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>We believe that open source software will still be the cornerstone of global tech infrastructure even 50 years from now — besides being a rapidly evolving code-generating component, it is also a globally decentralized cultural and social phenomenon. It is already everywhere, and the entropy of the tech infrastructure will only increase. So there will be a need to sustainably fund its maintenance. In the long term, the share of AI agents performing open source maintenance will increase, so OSE can achieve its targets faster than planned — some of the funds previously granted to people will instead go toward AI computing costs.</p>

                        <h3>Does OSE somehow relate to blockchain technologies?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>From a governance design perspective, OSE's principles resemble DAOs: transparent, decentralized, skin in the game, etc. However, OSE is a regular regulated US nonprofit corporation and not a crypto organization by any means. We will accept crypto donations (with proper KYC) in the future, but it is not a priority.</p>

                            <p>We designed OSE as a next-gen solution for the old OSS problem, which attracts most donations from a new category of donors (tech individuals) and thus increases funding of the global open source ecosystem. It complements existing OSS foundations without competing for resources.</p>
