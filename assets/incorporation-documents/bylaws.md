Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or committee of the Board of Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission. All waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
