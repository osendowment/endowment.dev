# Membership Policy

This policy governs membership in the Open Source Endowment Foundation (OSE),
defining members’ eligibility, privileges, and connections with the OSE Board of Directors
(the Board) and the OSE Executive Director (the Director).

1. **Eligibility Criteria**. Members are individuals who contribute a minimum of $1,000
per year to the OSE and support its mission.

2. **Monetary Contributions**. The gross USD value of donated assets (e.g., cash, stock)
is considered, regardless of associated transaction fees that may reduce the net
amount. OSE can recognize donations from a member’s personal legal entities, like
family trusts. Membership automatically commences upon receipt of the qualifying
contribution and lasts for the next X years, where X = gross USD donation / $1000.

3. **Roles and Privileges**. Members are central to OSE’s governance – they shape the
lasting endowment for open source sustainability and have the following privileges:
    - a) Advising the Board on strategic matters, including grant-making models
    - b) Appointing of community-nominated directors of the Board
    - c) Participating in exclusive OSE events, online resources, etc.
    - d) Receiving regular updates on OSE’s activities and development.
    - e) Any other rights and responsibilities set forth in OSE’s bylaws.

4. **Voting**. On matters that need member approval, each member shall be entitled to
vote by email or other methods approved by the Board. The voting period shall be
at least one week long. Other details for specific voting events are determined by
the Board, following the OSE's Bylaws and the Delaware law.﻿

5. **Disqualification**. In exceptional cases, the Board reserves the right to suspend or
terminate a membership if it determines, at its sole discretion, that the member's
association with OSE could undermine public trust or harm its reputation﻿ . To the
extent required by law, the affected individual will be provided notice and an
opportunity to respond prior to termination.

6. **Administration**. The Director oversees membership records, tracks contributions,
processes renewals, and communicates with members regarding their status and
privileges.

7. **Amendments**. The Board may amend this policy to align with OSE’s operational
needs and changing regulatory environment. Amendments shall not retroactively
affect the eligibility of current members.
